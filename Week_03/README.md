# Week 3: Image Processing and Classical Analysis Methods
January 19-23, 2026

## Overview
This week covers fundamental image processing techniques for microscopy data analysis, including spatial and frequency-domain filtering, contrast enhancement, and classical segmentation methods. Students will learn to apply these techniques to real microscopy datasets and understand when to use each approach.

## Monday: Image Processing Foundations
- Image filtering and noise reduction techniques
- Real-space and FFT-based contrast enhancement
- Histogram equalization and normalization

## Wednesday: Classical Image and Diffraction Analysis
- Morphological operations and segmentation methods
- Template matching and particle identification
- Diffraction pattern analysis using pyXEM

## Key Concepts
- **Spatial Filtering**: Gaussian (noise reduction), Median (salt-and-pepper noise)
- **Frequency-Domain Filtering**: FFT-based low/high/band-pass for structured noise removal
- **Contrast Enhancement**: Histogram equalization (global and adaptive/CLAHE)
- **Thresholding**: Global (Otsu, Yen) and local adaptive (Sauvola) methods
- **Watershed Segmentation**: Distance transform-based object separation
- **Template Matching**: Normalized cross-correlation for pattern localization
- **Morphological Operations**: Small object removal, hole filling, labeling

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, students should be able to:
1. Apply appropriate spatial filters (Gaussian, Median) to reduce noise in microscopy images
2. Perform FFT-based filtering to remove periodic artifacts or enhance specific frequencies
3. Use histogram equalization techniques to improve image contrast
4. Implement global and local thresholding methods for binary segmentation
5. Separate touching objects using watershed segmentation
6. Locate known patterns in images using template matching
7. Evaluate filter performance using quantitative metrics (MSE, SNR)
8. Choose appropriate preprocessing methods based on image characteristics and noise types
